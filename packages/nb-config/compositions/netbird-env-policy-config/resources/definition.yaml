                    THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                    through a Crossplane feature flag.
                    ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                    take on the managed and external resources.
                    This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                    release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                    values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                    custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
                    See the design doc for more information: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/499895a25d1a1a0ba1604944ef98ac7a1a71f197/design/design-doc-observe-only-resources.md?plain=1#L223
